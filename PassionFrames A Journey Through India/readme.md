## How It Works

- The gallery is built using semantic HTML `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` elements for accessibility and clarity.
- Each card displays an image and a caption with a link to more information.
- The layout is styled with CSS for a modern, clean look.
- JavaScript (with Color Thief) can be used to extract dominant colors from images for creative effects (e.g., background color matching).
